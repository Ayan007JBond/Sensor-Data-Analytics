## Description
This project focuses on a binary classification task from the collected data of sensors, where the goal is to accurately predict a target variable based on structured data. The approach involved cleaning and preprocessing the data, handling class imbalance, applying feature scaling, and experimenting with multiple machine learning models. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and ROC-AUC were used to compare model performance and fine-tune results.
